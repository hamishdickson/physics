Application: motion in a magnetic field
=======================================

Consider a positively charged particle moving in a uniform B field - Newton's law gives
 
m (dv/dt) = q ( v x B )

where 
v = particle's vector velocity

q = charge

m = mass

B = constant magnetic field

if v = (1, 0, 0) and B = (0, 0, 1), then solving analytically gives a velocity of v = (cos t, -sin t, 0)
